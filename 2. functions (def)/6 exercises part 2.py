# Note: The .join() method may be useful here. The .join() method allows you to join together strings in a list with some connector string. For example, some uses of the .join() method:
#
# >>> "--".join(['a','b','c'])
# >>> 'a--b--c'
# This means if you had a list of words you wanted to turn back into a sentence, you could just join them with a single space string:
#
# >>> " ".join(['Hello','world'])
# >>> "Hello world"
